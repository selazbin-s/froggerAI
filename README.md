## Description
Frogger navigates obstacles to get across a road and river, reaching the finish line at the top, indicating the finish line. Users can either play the game through a website or watch as the AI learns to play with python.


### This Document will go over:
* How to run the website
* How to run the python code (including downloading any necessary modules)
* Project requirements

#### **How to run the website**
To run the website you first need to install all the required nodes. A simple way to do this is to run ```npm install```. This will take a while.

Once that is done simply just run: 

```npm start```

Into a terminal window. If using an IDE that has npm scripts easily accesible then use that. **Make sure you have NPM installed on your local machine**

#### **How to run the python code**
The program requires you to have pygame installed and recommends you have the latest version of python. To install pygame simply run:

```pip install pygame```

Within a terminal window. Once that is done run:

```python game.py```
or
```python3 game.py```
**Make sure you have your root path set to where game.py is stored!**
if your $PATH variable doesn't associate python3 with the python command

### **Project Requirements**
Project required:
* Activity Diagram
* Use Case Diagram
* CRC Diagram
* Presentaion
* Test Cases

All of which can be found within the diagrams folder.
